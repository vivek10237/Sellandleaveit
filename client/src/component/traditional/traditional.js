                            <p> Most people do not have enough savings to live off their portfolios’ natural income (i.e., the dividends and interest). For example, a dividend yield of 2% requires savings on the order of 50x one’s annual spending budget; each $100,000 of spending would require approximately $5 million in savings. Of course, it is possible to find investments with higher yields. However, higher yields are generally associated with higher risk – whether they come from stocks or bonds. </p>

                            <p> When dividends and interest do not provide enough income, retirees are effectively forced to generate synthetic income by chiseling off from their portfolio to maintain the same level of spending. However, one should be careful with this approach because it can be a slippery slope. In particular, one loses the dividends and interest from any parts of the portfolio they sell. So this loss of natural income could require chiseling off more of the portfolio the following year, then even more the next year, and so on. To be sure, one should do their best to avoid a vicious cycle of accelerating portfolio depletion. </p>
                            <p> One factor that makes this situation more difficult to manage is the <em>forced selling</em>. In particular, having to chisel off synthetic income places one’s retirement security at the mercy of the market. Of course, markets can go up and inflate the prices at which holdings are sold – creating a welcome tailwind. However, markets can also experience declines. During these downturns, one must sell more holdings (e.g., more shares of a stock) to generate the same level of synthetic income. </p>
                            <p> Another important factor to consider is inflation. That is, the costs of many goods and services we pay for tend to go up through time. As a result, one’s spending needs in retirement may increase accordingly. This could exacerbate the issue above by requiring even more synthetic income to be chiseled off from the portfolio. The bottom line is that comprehensive and conservative planning is imperative to monitor and manage these risks. </p>

                            <p> The most common approach used to address the retirement income challenges highlighted above is to maintain a balanced portfolio (e.g., stocks and bonds1 ) and a safe withdrawal rate (SWR). </p>

                            <p> <img src={image1} /> <b> A Balanced Portfolio via Fixed Asset Allocation</b> The goal of a balanced portfolio is to provide enough growth to replenish the synthetic income that is chiseled off and keep up with inflation (to avoid the vicious cycle described above). Stock allocations are supposed to provide long-term growth in excess of inflation (a.k.a. real returns) while bond allocations (a.k.a. fixed income) should help diversify the portfolio and mitigate volatility without compromising purchasing power. Indeed, interest rates and bond yields generally serve as compensation for inflation – so investors can </p>

                            <p> save money without losing purchasing power.</p>
                            <p> If stocks are the source of growth, then why not allocate 100% to them? The issue is that stocks can be quite volatile and threaten retirement security. For example, consider a situation where stocks decline early in retirement but then go on to make up those losses and appreciate significantly thereafter. Returns may be good over the longer run, but some damage is made permanent due to the withdrawals during periods of depressed prices. </p>

                            <p> Not only would one be selling at depressed prices and locking in losses, but they would actuall be selling more holdings to generate the same level of withdrawal2 . This risk highlights the need for a balanced portfolio that is likely to satisfy the need for growth while minimizing the risk of portfolio depletion. Of course, the rate of withdrawal is a key factor here. Hence the phrase safe withdrawal rate (SWR). </p>

                            <p> The standard SWR strategy maintains a balanced portfolio with a fixed asset allocation. That is, one specifies the percentage allocations for stocks and bonds (e.g., 50%/50%) at the outset and then rebalances the portfolio periodically as allocations change due to market movements. Rebalancing to the target allocations may be done at a set frequency (e.g., annually) or when allocations deviate from the target percentage by a pre-specified threshold. </p>

                            <p> <b> Risk tolerance </b> <br/> In addition to balancing needs for growth with depletion risk, the SWR asset allocation should also integrate ones risk tolerance. Indeed, it is critical to construct portfolio asset allocations investors will be comfortable with – even when markets get volatile. A common mistake some investors and advisors make is maintaining allocations to stocks or other risk assets that are too large. </p>

                            <p> When markets are going up, larger stock allocations typically work well and boost confidence. However, investors sometimes lose their stomach for risk at the worst time – after markets decline. This can result in selling around market bottoms, locking in significant losses, and missing subsequent rebounds. Suffice to say, this is a situation that should be avoided. Thus it is important to make sure investors will be able to stomach potential portfolio declines and stay the course. </p>

                            <p> <b> So what is a sensible withdrawal rate? </b> <br/> The natural question many retirees and near-retirees ask is ‘What level of retirement spending is reasonable?’ There is no definitive answer, but there is plenty of research on the topic. One of the most popular rules of thumb has become known as the 4% rule. The idea is to set one’s withdrawals for retirement spending at 4% of their savings in the first year. Then they would adjust that level of withdrawal by inflation in each subsequent year. This approach was based </p>

                            <p>on William Bengen’s pioneering research on the topic3. He demonstrated that retirees utilizing this 4% SWR strategy and maintaining balanced portfolios historically experienced little risk of portfolio depletion..</p>
                            <p> It is worth noting this 4% rule of thumb is independent of the state of the markets (interest rates, stock valuations, dividend yields, etc.). It effectively plans for the worst market scenario. Thus, retirees or advisors pursuing such an approach may be unnecessarily erring too far on the side of caution. For example, our <span> research </span> and others <span className="a1"> (Kitces) </span> indicates cheaper valuations have historically allowed for higher withdrawal rates. </p>

                            <p> Another popular study which built on Bengen’s research became known as the <span> Trinity study </span>
                                (the real title was Retirement Spending: Choosing a Sustainable Withdrawal Rate) by professors
                                Philip L. Cooley, Carl M. Hubbard, and Daniel T. Walz at Trinity University in Texas. Brushing
                                some of the differences in technical assumptions, this study extended Bengen’s results by
                                looking at the success rates for similar combinations of portfolio compositions, withdrawal
                                rates, and time horizons. That is, instead of focusing exclusively on the highest successful SWR
                                across all market periods and catering to the worst case scenario, they delved deeper by
                                considering how often different SWRs succeeded. For example, the Trinity Study results could
                                allow one to select a SWR that had an acceptably low rate of failure while understanding it
                                involved slightly higher risk. </p>

                            <p> Suffice to say, there are many ways to analyze retirement strategies. The primary challenge is
                                dealing with the uncertainty of market performance. Leveraging historical data can help sift
                                through some of this uncertainty, but it is obviously limited to what has already happened (you
                                know the old saying ‘past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance’). So
                                some use <em> Monte Carlo<sup>4</sup></em>
                                simulations so they can consider scenarios that have not occurred in
                                the past but may be reasonable. </p>

                            <p> The volatility that comes along with stock portfolios is inevitable. Even if unlikely, future market
                                performance might be significantly different than what has happened in the past or what was
                                modeled in simulations. So the market dependence of SWR strategies will always expose them
                                to market risk. In order to accommodate this risk, some investors and advisors may have to
                                adjust their spending and asset allocations along the way as to avoid jeopardizing retirement
                                security. While helpful for managing risk, this dynamic approach introduces some uncertainty
                                for retirees and their future spending budgets.

                            <p> <b> Ongoing research </b> <br/> While most SWR strategies pursue variants of the approaches described above, it is a deep
                                topic with many moving parts. Accordingly, there is still much active research5
                                addressing the
                                market risk inherent within withdrawal strategies (dynamic and threshold-based spending,
                                sequence of return risk, glide paths, annuities, inflation-based investments, etc.). In general, the
                                research focuses either on dynamically modifying the withdrawal strategies or investigating
                                portfolio and investment strategies as a means of managing the risk. </p>
                            <p> <b> Implementation </b> <br/>
                                In terms of implementation, investors pursuing SWR strategies may leverage the services of an
                                investment professional or they can do it themselves. While it may be comforting to have
                                someone hold your hand and execute the strategy for you, it is important to consider the costs.
                                For example, consider a 1% advisor fee in the context of a 4% withdrawal rate. The fee would
                                consume approximately 25% of one’s retirement income. Furthermore, if this advisor used
                                expensive mutual funds with fees that were also on the order of 1% (this is unfortunately still
                                very common), then the combined fees (advisor plus fund fees) would amount to half of the
                                withdrawal income. Just think, work hard all your life just to share half of your retirement
                                income with the financial services industry. </p>

                            <p> Fortunately, some platforms now provide free rebalancing services and other tools that make
                                implementation easier. Moreover, there are a variety of low-cost index funds available to
                                investors. So it possible for investors to manage SWR strategies by themselves in a cost-efficient
                                manner.
                            </p>

                            <p> <b> SWR summary </b> <br/>
                                The SWR strategy is a popular and time-tested approach backed by much research. There are
                                plenty of advisors, planners, and tools devoted to the strategy. For those who are inclined to
                                do-it-yourself, implementation can be relatively straightforward. In fact, there are multiple
                                platforms that offer free robo- (automated) rebalancing. Implementing SWR without an advisor
                                and using low-cost index funds (e.g., Vanguard) can help retirees save on fees and get the most
                                out of their savings. </p>

                            <p> TOf course, SWR strategies are not perfect. As highlighted above, the one key risk virtually all
                                SWR strategies and related variations have is dependence on market performance. Despite the
                                many research studies and number crunching, the uncertainty due to the strategy’s market
                                dependence means there will always be some guesswork to determine what the true SWR is.
                                Moreover, markets may behave worse than history or simulations anticipate and force some to
                                reduce spending down the road. This can make some retirees nervous. </p>
                            <p> Another drawback of this market dependence is that it effectively forces retirees to steer quite
                                clear of risk because running out of money should be avoided at all costs. As a result, one
                                typically leans toward more conservative assumptions – specifically, lower withdrawal rates. </p>

                            <p> This and the logic behind SWR strategies planning for the worst case market scenarios can
                                induce many to live more conservatively than necessary. </p>
                            <p> There are also potential issues arising from the use of fixed asset allocations. For example, the
                                buying and selling required to maintain fixed allocations can trigger (capital gains) taxes. There
                                is also a more subtle performance implication. While the primary purpose of fixed allocations is
                                to help contain portfolio volatility, it can also systematically constrain growth. The base
                                assumption is that stocks will be the source of growth. However, each time they grow and
                                outpace other parts of the portfolio (e.g, bonds), some of them will be sold with the proceeds
                                being reinvested elsewhere to restore the percentage allocations. So the volatility constraint
                                effectively translates into a constraint on portfolio growth. </p>

                            <p> Lastly, SWR strategies are vulnerable to inflation – or even just the perceived threat of inflation.
                                Historically, stocks and bonds have both declined in the face of inflation or inflation scares6
                                .
                                Indeed, retirement researchers have highlighted the inflationary environments as a potential
                                Achilles heel of SWR strategies. This is due to the double-whammy situation of needing to chisel
                                off more income to cover rising costs at a time when portfolio values have likely declined. </p>

                            <p> <b> Note: </b> This section focuses on variable annuity products because they are comparable to
                                the SWR strategies above and happen to be one of the most highly marketed types of
                                annuities. We discuss fixed annuities within the Set It and Leave It section. </p>
                            <p> For investors who would like to insure themselves against market risks like those described
                                above, insurance companies offer guaranteed income via annuity products. For example,
                                variable
                                <sup> 7 </sup> annuity products allow investors to invest in balanced portfolios (similar to those used
                                in SWR strategies) while insuring minimum levels of lifetime income via additional options
                                called riders. If the portfolio becomes 100% depleted, then the insurance company would step
                                in and make the payments they guaranteed.
                            </p>

                            <p> In theory (and the marketing literature), this would allow one to achieve growth through gains
                                in the underlying portfolio while enjoying peace of mind from knowing they have a guaranteed
                                stream of income. So this can sound like a situation where one can eat their cake and have it
                                too. However, it is important to consider the details of these products (especially costs!) before
                                getting too excited. We discuss these details below. </p>

                            <p><b> The income guarantee </b> <br/>
                                The income guarantee that is most comparable to SWR strategies is the guaranteed lifetime
                                withdrawal benefit (GLWB). With a GLWB, an insurer typically guarantees a minimum-level of
                                annual withdrawals throughout your lifetime. However, it also allows for the level of
                                guaranteed income to increase as the value of the portfolio increases (but not decrease if the
                                portfolio declines).</p>
                            <p> The amount of guaranteed income is usually described as a percentage (e.g., 4%) of your
                                investment balance. Consider a $1 million portfolio with a 4% income guarantee. From day one,
                                the insurer would guarantee $40,000 (i.e., 4% of $1 million) of annual income for the annuity
                                owner. If the portfolio rises by 10%, then the percentage would be applied to the new, higher
                                portfolio value and raise the minimum guaranteed income to $44,000 per year. However, even
                                if the portfolio subsequently declines (or even depletes), the minimum guaranteed income will
                                remain at $44,000 (but still potentially go higher if the portfolio recovers and reaches new
                                highs).</p>

                            <p> Guaranteeing a stream of income that can potentially increase (but not decrease) is naturally a
                                desirable feature. However, this mechanism introduces a dependence on market performance.
                                In particular, the income will only increase when the portfolio grows. However, as we described
                                above for the SWR strategy, this can make a variable annuity with the GLWB vulnerable to
                                inflation too. If inflation rises and asset prices fall, then one would need to withdraw more
                                dollars at a time when the assets are worth less – thus requiring one to liquidate more assets.
                                On balance, the potential growth of income is a nice feature, but the mechanism through which
                                it works may expose one to inflation risk. </p>


                            <p> <b> Tax (dis)advantages </b> <br/>
                                Another one of the major selling points of annuities is their ability to defer taxes. Indeed, the
                                investments within annuities generally benefit from tax-deferred growth. Just as with qualified
                                retirement accounts (e.g., IRAs <sup>8 </sup> ), there are no taxes on stock dividends, bond interest, or
                                portfolio rebalancing inside of a variable annuity. This allows investments to compound at a
                                higher rate since Uncle Sam does not take a cut each year. All else equal, this is a significant
                                benefit. However, all else is not equal.
                            </p>
                            <p> Tax-deferred growth is naturally a positive. However, when taking money out of variable
                                annuities, portfolio earnings are distributed first and they are taxed as income (for taxable
                                accounts). If the same investments were held in a standard brokerage account without the
                                annuity wrapper, then gains would be taxed at the typically lower capital gains tax rate. So this
                                higher tax rate on the distributions clearly offsets some of the tax deferral benefit accrued
                                inside the annuity. In fact, it could actually make the overall tax impact net negative. That is, the
                                higher tax on earnings could outweigh the benefits of tax deferral. </p>

                            <p><b> The big catch (fees) </b> <br/>
                                <img src={image2} alt=""/> Regardless of the tax factors above, the guaranteed income is
                                an undeniably attractive feature. In fact, the income
                                guarantees combined with potential portfolio appreciation
                                often sound too good to be true. However, that is because the
                                costs of variable annuities are not always obvious. For
                                starters, the average fee on variable annuity contracts with
                                income guarantees is over 3% per year (even Vanguard’s is
                                around 2%). While some level of income may be guaranteed,
                                these kinds of fees naturally represent a significant headwind
                                for portfolio growth. In fact, we see some irony in observing that fees of this magnitude in
                                conjunction with withdrawals will make portfolio depletion even more likely – hence increasing
                                the need for the guarantee.</p>

                            <p> We suspect many investors and retirees who are being sold variable annuities are not aware of
                                all the fees embedded in these products. For example, 3% annual fees over a typical retirement
                                of, say, 25 years could consume half of one’s portfolio or more. While attempting to shield
                                themselves from the threat of market volatility, some may actually be guaranteeing they lose
                                (via fees) as much as they would in a market crash or more. Note: Technically, GLWB rider fees
                                are assessed as a percentage of the benefit base9
                                . So they could actually be significantly higher
                                when expressed as a percentage of the cash value (where fees are ultimately taken from).
                            </p>

                            <p> <b> Insured insurance </b> <br/>
                                An important factor one should consider when purchasing an annuity (or any insurance
                                product) is the creditworthiness of the insurance company. Sure, they may be making promises
                                that sound great, but will they have the ability to live up to their promises? Just as with any
                                corporation, it is possible for an insurance company to default – though it has been rare
                                throughout history. In general, risker insurance companies will offer higher payouts in order to
                                compensate investors for their higher risk status. </p>


                            <p> Fortunately, many states have guaranty programs whereby they regulate and help backup the
                                claims of the insurance companies operating within their state. In practice, a state regulator will
                                generally facilitate the transfer of assets and liabilities to another insurance company who will
                                continue to fulfil the failed firm’s promises. So this can provide an added layer of insurance to
                                the guarantees promised by insurance companies. </p>
                            <p> <b> Variable annuity summary </b> <br/>
                                In our view, the main attraction for variable annuities is the potential to obtain guaranteed
                                income for the rest of your life that has the ability to increase. Moreover, guaranty programs
                                are setup in many states to back up the claims and payouts of insurance companies that might
                                default (a historically rare phenomenon). Annuities also offer the potential tax deferral benefits
                                so that investments can compound at a higher rate. </p>

                            <p>Despite the simplicity with which variable annuities benefits are often presented, they are
                                highly complex products. We do not believe many people understand the mechanics of these
                                products in the context of taxation or inflation. For example, the tax deferral benefits are offset
                                by the earnings being distributed first and taxed as income. Moreover, higher inflation would
                                likely result portfolio declines and thus make the higher income guarantees less likely at the
                                precise time when they would be useful.</p>

                            <p> Notwithstanding the above issues, the biggest drawback is probably their high fees. This may
                                not be surprising given insurance companies are the only entities that can provide income
                                guarantees linked to lifespans. The end result is that many people effectively overpay to insure
                                income streams, in our view.</p>

                            <p> It is important to be sure you are aware of the good and bad points before purchasing a
                                variable annuity. Indeed, most products impose surrender periods during which one must pay a
                                penalty to get money out. These periods can be as long as 10 years and impose penalties of
                                10% or more (though the penalties typically fall by 1% per year until it drops to zero or the
                                surrender period expires). </p>

                            <p className="abc"> + In the context of a bond, a higher yield is usually a direct indication that the issuer has a higher risk of default
                                (i.e., you are less likely to get paid back). The situation is similar for stocks. Higher (dividend) yields typically
                                occur when the market sniffs out some potential risks and pushes share prices down. The lower share price
                                makes the dividend yield higher (since it is calculated by dividing the trailing dividends by the share price) but
